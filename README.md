he Knapsack Problem is a classic optimization problem in computer science and mathematics. In this problem, you have a knapsack (or backpack) with a fixed weight capacity and a set of items, each with a weight and a value. The goal is to maximize the total value of items placed in the knapsack without exceeding its weight limit.

Types of Knapsack Problem
0/1 Knapsack: You can either take an item completely or leave it. You can’t take a fraction of any item.
Fractional Knapsack: You can take any fraction of an item, making it possible to take a portion that fits within the remaining capacity.

Ethereum, MetaMask, and Solidity are core components of developing decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum blockchain. Here’s a brief explanation of each:

1. Ethereum:
Ethereum is a blockchain platform that enables developers to create decentralized applications (dApps) using smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts where the terms are directly written into code.
It uses Ether (ETH) as its cryptocurrency, which is used for transaction fees and computational services on the network.
2. MetaMask Wallet:
MetaMask is a popular Ethereum wallet and browser extension that allows users to interact with dApps directly in their web browsers.
It serves as a bridge between a user's Ethereum account and a dApp, enabling users to manage their Ethereum wallets, send and receive Ether, and interact with smart contracts.
MetaMask injects a web3 provider into the browser, allowing JavaScript applications to communicate with the Ethereum network.
3. Solidity:
Solidity is the primary programming language used to write smart contracts on Ethereum.
It’s a statically typed language with syntax similar to JavaScript, designed specifically for implementing smart contracts on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
